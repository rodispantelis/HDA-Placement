## Hyper-Distributed Applications Placement across the Compute Continuum

### Algorithms and simulation tools used in [1]

This project is based on the [SFC-Embedding project](https://github.com/rodispantelis/SFC-Embedding) and 
incorporates the following HDA placement methods

* **GA\DDL for multi-PoP network**.

* **Genetic Algorithm for multi-PoP and single Data Center networks**.

* **Distributed Deep Learning for single Data Center substrate network**. 

* **Distributed Greedy algorithm for multi-PoP and single Data Center networks**.

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the executable [.jar file](https://github.com/rodispantelis/HDA-Placement/tree/main/jar), 
from console (use jdk-18) without changing the file structure.
