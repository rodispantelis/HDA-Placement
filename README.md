## Hyper-Distributed Applications Placement across the Computing Continuum

### Algorithms and simulation tools

This project is based on the [SFV_Embedding](https://github.com/rodispantelis/SFC-Embedding) project 
and incorporates the following HDA placement methods

* **Hybrid Framework**.

* **Genetic Algorithm**.

* **Distributed Deep Learning**. 

* **Distributed Greedy algorithm**.

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the executable [.jar files](algorithms_v2/jar), 
from console (use jdk-18) without changing the file structure.
