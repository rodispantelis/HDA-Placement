## Hyper-Distributed Applications Placement across the Computing Continuum

### Algorithms and simulation tools

incorporates the following embedding methods

* **Genetic Algorithm**.

* **Distributed Deep Learning**. 

* **Distributed Greedy algorithm**.

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the executable [.jar files](algorithms_v2/jar), 
from console (use jdk-18) without changing the file structure.
